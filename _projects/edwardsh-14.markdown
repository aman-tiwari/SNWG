<h2>Phase 3:</h2>

<p>
    For phase 3, this is where the game's aesthetics and experience will shine. 
    
    I will be creating a visual of the player's orientation to indicate what orientation they are experiencing the world around them. 
    
    In addition, I will be developing algorithms for generating 3 - 5 unique environments for the player to explore.
    
    I will also develop a UI that will inform the player of the controls and the effects on the player and the world. My hope is that this will be accomplished with very few words to prevent distraction from the game's experience.
    
    Lastly, I will polish up the colors to enhance the visuals and experience within the game's world.
</p>

<h2>Progress: </h2>

<p>
    The important aspect I needed to fix was the nausea and motion sickness. After playing the game so many times, I realized how mentally taxing it was to experience a series of different rotations that the body would not feel while the mind tries to process them. So, I reasoned that by fading the screen black in the middle would take away some of that while not completely sacrificing the experience of changing angles. The result seemed much better than before.
    
    When designing my world, I wanted to create nature nodes that create unique experiences and reinforces the pleyer's sense of space. As it turned out, it wasn't as easy to simply put elements into a virtual void and expect people to eel like they're in a space. So, I created a grid system to give the illusion of space and let the elements affect the player's impression on it.
</p>

<h2>What's Next: </h2>

<p>
    For the final product, I will be polishing my nature elements for the besst experience possible. Afterwards, I will be implementing a UI and an orientation map as guidance for the players. Lastly, I will be fixing up the colors to create a more enriching experience.
