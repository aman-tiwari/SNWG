My first exploration into three.js was a long and frustrating one, albeit a satisfying one at the end. With each added skill that I learn, I open myself up further and further to having to deal with more bugs.

For this post, part of my struggles came from the new template the course put in place to organize the code and website. While the change was not great, for some reason it still was problematic. I realized that my issue was with the formatting of the code. To overcome this obstacle, I first turned to the boiler plate provided in the course. I felt that by editing the boiler plate, I would be able to ease myself into using three.js.

For my next post, I will be working on creating multiple windows in a single post.
