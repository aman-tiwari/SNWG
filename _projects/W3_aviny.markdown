For this assignment I chose two examples both interactive and both with unique motivations.

The first example is a car visualizer.  Here special attention is paid to lighting, materials, and textures.  The purpose is to create a realistic and immersive experience for visualizing a car.

The second example is a game.  Here the purpose is to be fun and playful.  The game is similar to a classic marble game.  As you rotate the mape cube, a marble rolls down the streets.
