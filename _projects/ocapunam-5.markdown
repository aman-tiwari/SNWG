<button type="button" id="stepButton">Add Step</button>

<div id="text">
Here is a simple walker definition I've implemented using three.js library. It is partially functional. Contrary to its name, the "Add Step" button currently does not add any steps to the walkerâ€™s path. As for my first impression of implementing three.js library in a web page, I can now easily understand why JS is a cancerous scripting language. In most cases where I needed to debug my code, I was not able to find the source of the problem.
