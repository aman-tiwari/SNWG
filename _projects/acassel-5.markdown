This is a scene I tried to make interactive using the raytracing, but I couldn't seem to figure it out. I used one of the sketches on the THREE.js website as a reference. Ideally, the watery texture is supposed to rotate with a first person controller. I also wanted to experiment with textures so I loaded in an image of crumbled paper.
