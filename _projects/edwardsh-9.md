Effects

On this lab, I messed around more with the lighting and the effects that are provided with it.

I adjusted the fog to be red so that the surface would appear to reflect the red sky that was provided. I really enjoyed playing around with the glitching effect as it usually something I would see as an intentional effect in movies rather than an unintentional error. I settled on using the Unchartered Effect as I felt that I could see all the objects and its lighiting more clearly.Mostly, I played with the lantern model as I wanted to understand importing objects better and experiment with the different materials that can be applied.

In the end, I still have a while to go before I can master lighiting, but I gained more insight on what kinds of effects can be applied to create a more engaging experience.
