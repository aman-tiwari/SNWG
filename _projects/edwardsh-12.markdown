<h2>Phase 2:</h2>

<p>
    For phase 2, the hope is that the player would be able to move and the bridge would continue to porperly be moved and updated for continued use. For a better experience, I also want the camera to be able to rotate to some degree without negatively affecting the rotation of the rotation nodes. This way, the player can enjoy the environment more freely than just staring stiffly in one direction. Lastly, I need to write code setting and resetting a goal object for player's to find and interact with to explore new worlds and experience over and over. This will mean getting some ideas on how and what to generate.
    
    In short, this phase is about finishing and polishing the technical parts and getting started with the aesthetics of the game.

<h2>Progress: </h2>

<p>
    Like with Phase 1, I did encounter a few errors and unintended results, but I did manage to finish a majority of the technical parts of the program. 
    
    What I am mostly concerned about is how much narrative is involved in this game. While I do believe the inclusion of the goal and restting of the world will give players an incentive to continue playing and exploring at different angles, I cannot help but feel that there must be something more I can do to bring out an even more enriching experience for the players. 
    
    My choice in the the types and methods of generating environemnts will certainly play an improtant role in building a strong narrative for the game. I'm also looking at games like Monument Valley, Antichamber, and Journey for ideas on how to expand from here.
