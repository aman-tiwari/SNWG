<h2>Objective:</h2>

<p>
    The objective of this project was to create and explore a world that allows a free range of movement and perspective to interpret the environment in ways no posiible from normal right-side up standpoints. This will take form of a prototype game inspired by Monument Valley, as it allows players to move their character in ways that are not normally possible.
</p>


<h2>Gameplay:</h2>

<p>
    In the start of the game, the players will be instructed on the controls and will move to the goal as a small tutorial of sorts. This will hopefully indicate what the objective of the game without too many words so that they don't get distracted from the gameplay.<br /> <br /> 
    
    The players can move by crossing the bridge that follows their every move and rotating on the nodes they currently stand on.<br /> <br /> 
    
    Upon reaching the goal, the game will first reveal a 3D grid that will build a sense of space in the void they occupied and create a light containment to immerse them further. The goal will then be reset on a random node. From then on, everytime the player reaches the goal, the computer will generate one of three worlds at random with random features to keep the experience fresh. <br /> <br /> 
    
    Each game world has its own unique feel. The first one consists of cubes of various sizes that affect the player's experience while walking the bridge. The second one generates a random number transparent "rooms" in  the nodes the player can move to. This is meant to create a sense of inside and outside. The third one consists of crystal like structures all around the world. The effect is similar to the first one, except it further encourages players to look around more to explore different ways of interpreting the environment around them.<br /> <br />
    
    Also, to make the exploration more enriching the game will start with just one color for each nature element. But, every round the player reaches the goal, there will be a new color the computer can choose from when constructing the worlds. Players will have the freedom to endlessy explore evolving worlds and discover new ways to interpret their surroundings in new unique ways.<br /> <br /> 
</p>


<h2>Final Thoughts: </h2>

<p>
    I feel the project gave me an excellent direction to go from. While the program may need more work as a game, I feel I had learned a lot from it as an experiment.<br /> <br /> 
    
    If I were to continue working with this project, I may decide to program the computer to generate separate levels with set paths instead a broad world for an even more enriching gameplay. I would also like to reprogram the controls to make a more fluid progression throughout the game. With imported models, I feel I can give players a more clear reference to how they would like to interpret the angle and perspective, in which they are experiencing the world.<br /> <br /> 
    
    Overall, I think the game mechanic that I programmed is full of endless possibilites for me to explore further into.<br /> <br />
