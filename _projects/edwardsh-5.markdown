WATER WHEEL

A fun Three.js project featuring a water wheel. This was inspired by The Aviator project 

(https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/), 

where the plane flies over a watery world made of a rotating cylinder. Thinking about this, a water wheel came to mind.
My hope in creating this project was to get familiar with three.js's framework, particularly the transformations and 
3D objects/group functions. I was also testing my judgement incolor palettes as well. I believe I was able to learn a lot of this.
Next time, I hope to learn more on materials and interactions, particularly raycasters.
