<h2>Phase 2:</h2>

<p>
    For phase 2, the hope is that the player would be able to move and the bridge would continue to porperly be moved and updated for continued use. For a better experience, I also want the camera to be able to rotate to some degree without negatively affecting the rotation of the rotation nodes. This way, the player can enjoy the environment more freely than just staring stiffly in one direction. Lastly, I need to write code setting and resetting a goal object for player's to find and interact with to explore new worlds and experience over and over. This will mean getting some ideas on how and what to generate.

    In short, this phase is about finishing and polishing the technical parts and getting started with the aesthetics of the game.

<h2>Progress: </h2>

<p>
    Like with Phase 1, I did encounter a few errors and unintended results, but I did manage to finish a majority of the technical parts of the program. Curiously, parenting for all actions work differently, so I had to experiment a lot before finally getting the program to run as intended.

    Also, I decided to shift the bridge forward after the player crosses. I realized the huge difference between Monument Valley and this program and felt that forcing players to turn the bridge 180 degrees to move forward would only annoy and possibly confuse players. As a plus, I felt that this move breathes life into the bridge and creates a degree of companionship for the player, similar to Totem in the Monument Valley Series

    My choice in the the types and methods of generating environemnts will certainly play an improtant role in further developing a strong narrative for the game. I'm also looking at games like Monument Valley, Antichamber, and Journey for ideas on how to expand from here.

<h2>What's Next: </h2>

<p>
    For the final phase, I will develop algorithms for 3 - 5 unique environments to generate and incorporate them into the program. Once that has been finalized, I hope to develop an effective UI and polish the game's color and light.
