<h2>Project Proposal:</h2>

<p>
    For my final project, I am thinking of extending from one of my previous assignments. It involved making a minature replica of Monument Valley 2's level, The Sunken City.<br /><br />

    I want create a larger grid of the nodes that make up my previous assignment and add a "player" to my program. From there I will change the perspective from world orthographic to first-person perspective and populate the environment with computer generated elements. The demo above is a simplified version of what my final project would look like.

    Press x, y, and/or z to rotate the perspective in their respective axes.

<h2>Purpose: </h2>

<p>
    When I saw the series of impossible physics applied in the Monument Valley Series, I became curious as to how a change in perspective changes the way way we interpret the shapes, space, environment, and everthing else that is around us. My hope is to put ourselves in a similar position using Monument Valley as a base to explore that concept. I further decided to have the computer procedurally generate the environment to make different possibilities into this idea.

<h2>Inspirations</h2>

<p>
    Monument Valley series and Mass Migration (https://massmigrations.com/)
</p>

<h2>Plan</h2>

<p>
    <li>
        <ol>Phase 1: Rebuild the node grid system </ol>
        <ol>Phase 2: Create player and camera for first-person perspective </ol>
        <ol>Phase 3: Experiment and implement an algorithm for generating the environment </ol>
    </li>
</p>
